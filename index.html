      <p id='synopsis'>Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a colorless and odorless chemical compound, also referred to by some as Dihydrogen Oxide, Hydrogen Hydroxide, Hydronium Hydroxide, or simply Hydric acid. Its basis is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a species shown to mutate DNA, denature proteins, disrupt cell membranes, and chemically alter critical neurotransmitters. The atomic components of DHMO are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.

        DHMO causes thousands of deaths every year, most of them from accidental inhalation. But the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death

           Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is perhaps the single most prevalent of all chemicals that can be dangerous to human life. Despite this truth, most people are not unduly concerned about the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide. Governments, civic leaders, corporations, military organizations, and citizens in every walk of life seem to either be ignorant of or shrug off the truth about Dihydrogen Monoxide as not being applicable to them. This concerns us.

        <h5>Dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide</h5>
        <ul id='dangers'>
          <li>Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.</li>
          <li>Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.</li>
          <li>Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.</li>
          <li>Contamination of electrical systems often causes short-circuits.</li>
          <li>Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.</li>
          <li>Found in biopsies of pre-cancerous tumors and lesions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="bodyHead">How Your Body Reacts to DHMO </h5>
      <ol>
        <li>First 5 minutes</li>
        Your taste buds send messages to your brain triggering neuronal responses as if the dihydrogen monoxide had already reached your bloodstream
        <li>10 minutes</li>
        Neurons in the anterior hypothalamus show a decrease in firing as dihydrogen monoxide is absorbed by the tongue
        <li>20 minutes</li>
        Your plasma and blood cell deuterium to protium ratio begins to rise from 140 to 26 ppm
        <li>25 minutes</li>
        The consumption of dihydrogen monoxide begins to make you feel more alert. This is the same way cocaine makes you feel, by the way.
        <li>45 minutes</li>
        Dihydrogen monoxide is absorbed through the large intestine and makes its way into your bloodstream.
        <li>60+ minutes</li>
        The remaining dihydrogen monoxide that was not absorbed into your system is flushed out through your urine and stool
